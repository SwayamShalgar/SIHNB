# Blockchain Status - Quick Answer

## ❓ Is the certificate hash being stored on blockchain?

### Answer: **CODE IS READY, BUT NOT ACTIVE** ⚠️

---

## Current Status:

### ✅ What's Working:

- Certificate hash generation (SHA-256)
- Blockchain code fully implemented
- Graceful fallback when blockchain unavailable
- Database storage working perfectly
- IPFS (Pinata) upload working

### ❌ What's Not Active:

- **Blockchain storage** - Using placeholder credentials
- No real wallet configured
- No contract deployed

---

## Why It's Not Active:

**In `/server/.env`:**

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here              ← Placeholder
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address_here    ← Placeholder
```

**Result:**

- Certificates are stored in **database only**
- Blockchain TX hash is **null** in database
- System returns **mock blockchain responses**

---

## What Happens When You Issue a Certificate:

```
1. Generate certificate PDF ✅
2. Calculate SHA-256 hash ✅
3. Upload to Pinata IPFS ✅
4. Store in PostgreSQL database ✅
5. Try to store on blockchain:
   → Check if contract configured
   → ❌ Not configured (placeholder values)
   → ⚠️ Skip blockchain storage
   → ✅ Return success (with mock=true)
6. Certificate issued successfully ✅
```

**Bottom Line:** Everything works, but blockchain storage is **skipped** due to missing configuration.

## To Enable Real Blockchain Storage:

### Quick Steps (20 minutes):

1. **Get MetaMask wallet** → Copy private key
2. **Get Mumbai MATIC** → Free from faucet
3. **Deploy contract** → Use Remix IDE
4. **Update .env:**
   ```env
   PRIVATE_KEY=0x1234...your_real_key
   CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x5678...deployed_address
   ```
5. **Restart server** → Blockchain active! ✅

## Current System Works Fine Without Blockchain:

- ✅ Certificates issued successfully
- ✅ PDFs stored on IPFS
- ✅ All data in secure database
- ✅ QR codes work
- ✅ Verification works

**You can use it as-is, or enable blockchain for extra security.**
