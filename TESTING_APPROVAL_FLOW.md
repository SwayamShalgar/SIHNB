### Backend (‚úÖ Complete):
- Company/Institute registrations set `verified = FALSE`
- Login blocked for unverified accounts
- Admin API endpoints for approval/rejection
- Database schema with `verified` column

### Frontend (‚úÖ Complete):
- Registration shows pending approval message
- Login shows clear error for pending accounts
- **Admin Dashboard now has Verification tab**
- Approve/Reject buttons functional

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "No pending users showing in admin dashboard"

**Possible Causes:**
1. No Company/Institute accounts registered yet
2. All accounts already approved
3. Database missing `verified` column

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check if verified column exists
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name='users' AND column_name='verified';

-- Add column if missing
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;

-- Check for pending users
SELECT * FROM users WHERE verified = FALSE;
```

### Issue: "Institute still cannot login after approval"

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check verified status in database
SELECT id, email, role, verified FROM users WHERE email = 'testinstitute@example.com';

-- Manually verify if needed
UPDATE users SET verified = TRUE WHERE email = 'testinstitute@example.com';
```

### Issue: "Student account showing as pending"

**Solution:**
Check the registration logic - Students should have `verified = TRUE` by default.

```javascript
// In server/routes/auth.js, verify this logic:
const requiresVerification = ['Company', 'Institute'].includes(role);
const verifiedStatus = !requiresVerification; // Should be TRUE for Student
```

### Issue: "Admin cannot see pending users tab"

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify admin token is valid

### Issue: "Approval/Reject buttons not working"

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend is running: `http://localhost:5002`
3. Check admin token in localStorage
4. Verify API endpoints are accessible:
   ```
   GET http://localhost:5002/api/admin/pending-users
   POST http://localhost:5002/api/admin/approve-user/:id
   POST http://localhost:5002/api/admin/reject-user/:id
   ```

## üìä Database Queries for Verification

### Check Pending Users:
```sql
SELECT id, email, role, full_name, organization, verified, created_at 
FROM users 
WHERE verified = FALSE 
  AND role IN ('Company', 'Institute')
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check Verified Users:
```sql
SELECT id, email, role, full_name, verified 
FROM users 
WHERE verified = TRUE
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Manual Approval (if needed):
```sql
UPDATE users 
SET verified = TRUE 
WHERE id = 123; -- Replace with actual user ID
```

### Manual Rejection (if needed):
```sql
DELETE FROM users 
WHERE id = 123 AND verified = FALSE; -- Replace with actual user ID
```

### Check All Users by Role:
```sql
SELECT role, verified, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM users 
GROUP BY role, verified
ORDER BY role, verified;
```
