# ⚡ CRITICAL FIX - Build Script Error

## 🔴 The Problem
```
sh: line 1: react-scripts: command not found
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 127
```

**Root Cause**: Client dependencies weren't installed before running build.

---

## ✅ The Fix

### Updated Files:

#### 1. `package.json` (Root)
Changed build commands to use `--prefix` instead of `cd`:
```json
"build": "npm install --prefix client && npm run build --prefix client",
"vercel-build": "npm install --prefix client && npm run build --prefix client"
```

#### 2. `vercel.json`
Simplified configuration with explicit build command:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "buildCommand": "cd client && npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "client/build",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "server/index.js",
      "use": "@vercel/node"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 Deploy Again

### Push the fix:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Install client dependencies before build"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy with the fix! ✨

## 📊 What Will Happen Now

1. ✅ Vercel clones your repo
2. ✅ Runs: `cd client && npm install` ← **This was missing!**
3. ✅ Installs react-scripts and all dependencies
4. ✅ Runs: `npm run build`
5. ✅ Creates optimized production build
6. ✅ Deploys successfully! 🎉
