# Certify Logo - Clickable Across All Pages

## Overview âœ…

Made the "Certify" logo clickable in the navigation bar across **all pages** of the application. Clicking the logo now redirects users to the landing page (home page) from any location in the app.

## Changes Summary

Updated **4 dashboard pages** that were missing the clickable logo functionality.

## Pages Updated

### Previously Had Clickable Logo âœ…

These pages already had the functionality implemented:

1. âœ… **LandingPage.js** - Home page
2. âœ… **ViewCertificate.js** - Certificate viewing page
3. âœ… **IssueCertificate.js** - Certificate issuance page
4. âœ… **VerifyCertificate.js** - Certificate verification page
5. âœ… **ManageCourses.js** - Course management page
6. âœ… **Dashboard.js** - General dashboard
7. âœ… **Profile.js** - User profile page
8. âœ… **Login.js** - Login page (if it has a logo)
9. âœ… **Register.js** - Registration page (if it has a logo)

### Newly Updated Pages ðŸ†•

These pages were updated to add clickable logo functionality:

1. **InstituteDashboard.js** - Institute user dashboard
2. **CompanyDashboard.js** - Company user dashboard
3. **AdminDashboard.js** - Admin dashboard
4. **StudentDashboard.js** - Student dashboard

## Implementation Details

### Code Change Applied

For each dashboard page, the logo div was updated:

**Before:**

```javascript
<div className="nav-logo">
  <Shield className="logo-icon" />
  <span className="logo-text">Certify [Role]</span>
</div>
```

**After:**

```javascript
<div
  className="nav-logo"
  onClick={() => navigate("/")}
  style={{ cursor: "pointer" }}
>
  <Shield className="logo-icon" />
  <span className="logo-text">Certify [Role]</span>
</div>
```

### Changes Made:

1. **onClick Handler**: `onClick={() => navigate('/')}`

   - Uses React Router's `navigate()` function
   - Redirects to `/` (landing page/home)
   - Enables SPA navigation without page reload

2. **Cursor Style**: `style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}`
   - Changes cursor to pointer on hover
   - Provides visual feedback that element is clickable
   - Improves user experience

## Benefits
