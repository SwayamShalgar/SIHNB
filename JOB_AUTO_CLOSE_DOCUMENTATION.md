# Job Posting Auto-Close on Offer Acceptance

## Feature Overview
When a student accepts a job offer, the system automatically closes the job posting and hides it from other students, preventing further applications.

---

## Business Logic

### What Happens When a Student Accepts an Offer?

1. ‚úÖ **Offer Status Updated** ‚Üí `accepted`
2. ‚úÖ **Student's Application Status Updated** ‚Üí `accepted`
3. ‚úÖ **Job Posting Status Changed** ‚Üí `filled` (previously `active`)
4. ‚úÖ **Other Pending Applications Closed** ‚Üí Status changed to `closed`
5. ‚úÖ **Job Hidden from Search** ‚Üí No longer visible to other students

---

## Implementation Details

### Backend (`server/routes/jobs.js`)

**Route: `PATCH /api/jobs/offers/:id/respond`**

```javascript
if (status === 'accepted') {
  // 1. Update the accepted student's application
  await pool.query(`
    UPDATE job_applications 
    SET status = 'accepted', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE job_id = $1 AND student_id = $2
  `, [job_id, student_id]);
  
  // 2. Close the job posting (mark as filled)
  await pool.query(`
    UPDATE job_postings 
    SET status = 'filled', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE id = $1
  `, [job_id]);
  
  // 3. Close all other pending applications
  await pool.query(`
    UPDATE job_applications 
    SET status = 'closed', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE job_id = $1 AND student_id != $2 AND status = 'pending'
  `, [job_id, student_id]);
}
```

### Frontend Filtering

**Job Listings (`GET /api/jobs/postings`)**
```javascript
WHERE jp.status = 'active'  // Only shows active jobs, not 'filled'
AND jp.application_deadline >= CURRENT_DATE
```

**Student Applications Tab**
```javascript
applications.filter(app => 
  app.status !== 'accepted' && 
  app.status !== 'closed'
)
```
Only shows applications that are:
- ‚úÖ Pending
- ‚úÖ Shortlisted
- ‚úÖ Interviewing
- ‚úÖ Rejected

Hides applications that are:
- ‚ùå Accepted (moved to Job Offers tab)
- ‚ùå Closed (job was filled by another candidate)

## User Experience Flows

### Flow 1: Student A Accepts Offer

**Initial State:**
- Job Posting: `active` (visible to all)
- Student A Application: `pending`
- Student B Application: `pending`
- Student C Application: `shortlisted`

**Student A Accepts Offer:**
```
1. Student A receives offer ‚Üí Clicks "Accept Offer"
2. System updates:
   - Offer Status: pending ‚Üí accepted ‚úì
   - Student A Application: pending ‚Üí accepted ‚úì
   - Job Posting: active ‚Üí filled ‚úì
   - Student B Application: pending ‚Üí closed ‚úì
   - Student C Application: shortlisted ‚Üí closed ‚úì
```

**New State:**
- Job Posting: `filled` (‚ùå no longer visible to new students)
- Student A: Sees "Congratulations!" in Job Offers tab
- Student A: Application removed from "My Applications"
- Student B: Application disappears from "My Applications"
- Student C: Application disappears from "My Applications"

### Flow 2: Student Viewing Jobs

**Before Acceptance:**
```
Student logs in ‚Üí Jobs Tab
Sees: 10 active job postings
```

**After Another Student Accepts:**
```
Student logs in ‚Üí Jobs Tab
Sees: 9 active job postings (filled job hidden)
```

**If Student Had Applied to Filled Job:**
```
Student ‚Üí My Applications Tab
Previous Applications: 5 ‚Üí Now: 4
(Closed application automatically removed from view)
```

## Company Dashboard Impact

### Job Postings View
Companies can see all their postings including filled ones:

```javascript
// Company sees filled jobs with special badge
<span className="status-badge filled">
  Filled
</span>
```

**Visual Indicators:**
- üü¢ Active (green) - Currently accepting applications
- üîµ Filled (blue-green) - Position has been filled
- ‚ö™ Closed (gray) - Manually closed by company

### Application Management
When a job is filled:
- ‚úÖ Company can still view all applications (including closed ones)
- ‚úÖ Application count remains accurate
- ‚úÖ Company can see which student accepted the offer

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Multiple Offers for Same Job
‚ùå **Prevented:** Companies can only send one offer per student per job (UNIQUE constraint)

### 2. Student Accepts After Job Filled
‚ùå **Prevented:** Students can't see filled jobs, so can't apply

### 3. Company Manually Closes Job
‚úÖ **Handled:** Companies can manually set status to `closed` to stop applications

### 4. Application Status Conflicts
‚úÖ **Handled:** 
- Accepted applications are never overwritten
- Closed status only applies to pending applications

### 5. Offer Rejection
‚úÖ **Handled:** 
- If student rejects offer, job remains `active`
- Other students' applications remain unchanged
- Only changes when student **accepts**

---

## Database Queries

### Check Active Jobs Only
```sql
SELECT * FROM job_postings 
WHERE status = 'active' 
AND application_deadline >= CURRENT_DATE;
```

### Find All Filled Positions
```sql
SELECT 
  jp.*,
  u.full_name as accepted_student
FROM job_postings jp
JOIN job_offers jo ON jp.id = jo.job_id
JOIN users u ON jo.student_id = u.id
WHERE jp.status = 'filled' 
AND jo.status = 'accepted';
```

### Student's Active Applications
```sql
SELECT * FROM job_applications
WHERE student_id = $1
AND status NOT IN ('accepted', 'closed')
ORDER BY applied_at DESC;
```

## Configuration Options

### Optional Behaviors (Can be customized)

**Auto-close other applications:**
```javascript
// Current: Closes pending applications
// Alternative: Keep them visible with "position filled" message
WHERE status = 'pending'  // Can add more statuses
```

**Job visibility after filling:**
```javascript
// Current: Completely hidden
// Alternative: Show with "Position Filled" tag
WHERE status = 'active'  // Could be: WHERE status IN ('active', 'filled')
```

**Reopen job option:**
```javascript
// Future: Allow companies to reopen filled positions
UPDATE job_postings SET status = 'active' WHERE id = $1;
```

---

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Metrics to Track
- Time to fill (job creation ‚Üí filled)
- Applications per filled position
- Acceptance rate
- Jobs filled vs jobs expired
- Average applications before filling

### SQL Analytics Queries

**Average Time to Fill:**
```sql
SELECT 
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (updated_at - created_at))/86400) as avg_days_to_fill
FROM job_postings
WHERE status = 'filled';
```

**Filled Jobs Today:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_postings
WHERE status = 'filled'
AND DATE(updated_at) = CURRENT_DATE;
```
