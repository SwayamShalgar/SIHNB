# Get Started Button - Smart Navigation Update

## Change Overview ✅

Updated the "Get Started" button on the landing page (home page) to provide intelligent navigation based on user authentication status.

## Previous Behavior ❌

**Before:**
- The "Get Started" button always navigated to `/issue` (Issue Certificate page)
- This was not ideal because:
  - Unauthenticated users would see the issue page without proper access
  - Different user roles need different starting points
  - Students and companies shouldn't start at the issue page

## New Behavior ✅

**After:**
- The "Get Started" button now uses the `getDashboardRoute()` function
- **Smart Navigation Logic:**
  - **Not Logged In** → Redirects to `/login` page
  - **Logged In as Admin** → Redirects to `/admin-dashboard`
  - **Logged In as Institute** → Redirects to `/institute-dashboard`
  - **Logged In as Student** → Redirects to `/student-dashboard`
  - **Logged In as Company** → Redirects to `/company-dashboard`

## Implementation Details

### Code Change
**File:** `/client/src/pages/LandingPage.js`

**Changed Line 144:**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
<button onClick={() => navigate('/issue')} className="btn-hero-primary">

// AFTER:
<button onClick={() => navigate(getDashboardRoute())} className="btn-hero-primary">
```

### Existing Helper Function
The component already had the `getDashboardRoute()` helper function (lines 46-56):

```javascript
const getDashboardRoute = () => {
  if (!user) return '/login';
  
  const dashboardRoutes = {
    Admin: '/admin-dashboard',
    Institute: '/institute-dashboard',
    Student: '/student-dashboard',
    Company: '/company-dashboard'
  };
  
  return dashboardRoutes[user.role] || '/login';
};
```

This function:
1. Checks if user exists
2. Returns the appropriate dashboard route based on user role
3. Falls back to `/login` if user doesn't exist or role is unknown

## Benefits

✅ **Better User Experience**
   - Users are directed to the right place based on their login status
   - No confusion or access errors

✅ **Role-Based Navigation**
   - Each user type gets their appropriate dashboard
   - Institutes can issue certificates
   - Students can view their certificates
   - Companies can verify certificates
   - Admins get admin controls

✅ **Security**
   - Non-authenticated users are prompted to login first
   - No direct access to protected pages

✅ **Consistent Behavior**
   - Same logic used throughout the application
   - Predictable navigation flow

## User Flow Examples

2. Clicks "Get Started"
3. → Redirected to Login page
4. After login, redirected to appropriate dashboard

### Example 2: Institute User (Logged In)

2. Clicks "Get Started"
3. → Redirected to Student Dashboard
4. Can view their certificates and verifications

### Example 4: Company User (Logged In)
