5. Stored in PostgreSQL database ✅
6. **Response sent to frontend immediately** ✅
7. SQLite backup (async, optional) ✅

**Log Evidence**:

```
📝 Certificate issuance request received

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### If Server Won't Start

1. Check port availability:

   ```bash
   lsof -i :5001
   ```

2. Kill any blocking process:

   ```bash
   lsof -ti:5001 | xargs kill -9
   ```

3. Verify .env file exists and has correct values

### If Certificates Not Uploading to Pinata

1. Test Pinata connection:

   ```bash
   cd server
   node test-pinata-connection.js
   ```

2. Check server logs for Pinata upload messages
3. Verify API credentials in .env

### If Frontend Shows "Loading"

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify server is running on port 5001
3. Check Network tab in DevTools for failed requests

---

## ✅ System Health Check

Run these commands to verify everything:

```bash
# 1. Test Pinata connection
cd server && node test-pinata-connection.js

# 2. Upload test certificate
cd server && node test-upload-certificate.js

# 3. Check server can start
cd server && npm start

# 4. Check frontend can start
cd client && npm start
```
